# ✅ Gemini API Integration - FIXED & OPTIMIZED

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: All chat responses were identical regardless of the user's prompt

**Root Cause**: The API was falling back to rule-based responses because:
1. Tried using `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-pro` models which weren't available with the API key
2. Gemini API errors caused fallback to local rule-based responses

**Solution**: Updated to use the latest available Gemini model

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Identified Available Models**
Ran `genai.list_models()` to discover 50+ available Gemini models with the API key

### 2. **Updated Model Priority**
Changed from attempting unavailable models to using confirmed available ones:
```python
model_names = ["gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-2.0-flash", "gemini-pro-latest", "gemini-1.5-pro"]
```

### 3. **Gemini 2.5 Flash Selected**
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` (Latest & Fastest)
- **Status**: ✅ Confirmed available
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed
- **Quality**: Excellent for mental health conversations

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added proper exception catching for each model
- Clear logging when Gemini successfully generates responses
- Graceful fallback if all models fail

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Test 1: Anxiety Prompt
**Input**: "I feel anxious and overwhelmed"
**Output**: *Custom Gemini response* - "you're carrying a lot right now..." ✅

### Test 2: Sadness Prompt
**Input**: "I'm feeling very sad"
**Output**: *Custom Gemini response* - "I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling very sad..." ✅

### Test 3: Anger Prompt
**Input**: "I'm really angry"
**Output**: *Custom Gemini response* - "you're feeling a lot of anger right now..." ✅

**Result**: Each prompt now receives a UNIQUE, thoughtfully-tailored response from Gemini! 🎉

## 📝 Code Changes

### File: `backend/app.py`

**Updated `call_llm()` function:**
- ✅ Added multi-model fallback (tries models in order)
- ✅ Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` as primary
- ✅ Improved error messages for debugging
- ✅ Proper response validation
- ✅ Stream disabled for reliability

```python
# Updated priority order
model_names = [
    "gemini-2.5-flash",      # Latest - PRIMARY
    "gemini-2.0-flash",      # Alternative
    "gemini-pro-latest",     # Fallback
    "gemini-1.5-pro"         # Last resort
]
```
