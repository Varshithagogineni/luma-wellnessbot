# 🎙️ Voice Features & Chat Improvements

## ✅ Recent Updates

### 1. **Removed Repetitive Preamble Text** ✨

**Problem**: Every bot response started with the same preamble:
```
"I'm really glad you reached out. I'm here to listen. I can't provide medical advice..."
```

**Solution**: Removed the preamble concatenation from the backend
- Now returns only the Gemini AI response
- Cleaner, more natural conversations
- Each response is unique and contextual

**File Changed**: `backend/app.py` (line 216)
```python
# OLD: content = guard["preamble"] + "\n\n" + llm_resp.strip()
# NEW: content = llm_resp.strip()
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Direct Gemini responses
- ✅ No repeated opening text
- ✅ More engaging conversations

### 2. **Added Listen Button** 🔊

**Feature**: Listen to bot responses with one click

**How It Works**:
1. Click the **🔊 Listen** button on any bot response
2. The bot's response is played out loud using text-to-speech
3. Button changes to **⏹️ Stop**
4. Click **⏹️ Stop** anytime to cancel playback
5. When finished, button returns to **🔊 Listen**

**Technology**:
- Uses browser's native Web Speech API
- Works on all modern browsers
- No additional downloads needed
- Respects user preferences

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/chat.js` - Added listen functionality
- `frontend/style.css` - Added button styling

### 3. **Visual Feedback** 🎨

**Button States**:

| State | Display | Animation |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Default | 🔊 Listen | Normal |
| Hover | 🔊 Listen (brighter) | Scale up 1.05x |
| Playing | ⏹️ Stop | Pulsing glow |
| Stopped | 🔊 Listen | Back to normal |

**CSS Features**:
- Smooth transitions (0.2s)
- Pulsing animation during playback
- Color matches app accent
- Responsive and accessible

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Chat Normally
```
User: "I feel anxious today"
```

### Step 2: Receive Gemini Response
```
Bot: "I hear that you're feeling anxious. Let's try the 5-4-3-2-1 
grounding technique: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 
3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste."
```
*(No preamble - direct response)*

### Step 3: Click Listen
- Look for **🔊 Listen** button below the response
- Click it to hear the response
- Button becomes **⏹️ Stop**

### Step 4: Stop Anytime
- Click **⏹️ Stop** to cancel playback
- Button reverts to **🔊 Listen**
